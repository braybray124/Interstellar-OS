# Interstellar-OS
This is my Linux distro build off LFS/ Linux From Scratch sorry if this wont be maintained fully and but you guys can maintain it yourself and help along like subbmit your tarballs and so others can use and me the Offical maintainer wont be able to fully update it becuase im in school still but have fun when i fully ship this out 

I Reccomend for this to be installed with the Gentoo installer but until then when i build the installer so you all can install it it will have the portage package manager and use either the regualar linux kernel with some of mine tweaks of mine to make it fully sutiable for this and your needs i will slowly up date this Readme for you all will more info about the distro.


Sorry guys there is a delay in it im the whole thing just borked so i gotta make time to rebuild it but here is the files of it when i was building it on my own personal PC you are going to have to edit it for your own system Emerge is still borked and trying to get it to work if you can fix it and ill give you credit and upload it to this Repo.
